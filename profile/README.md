## About

This pack is a collection of plugins made by PandaDev and SomeGreenDude, aimed at improving the Minecraft experience and adding lots of new features while also staying true to the game.

Every feature in this pack is can be run on the same server as a single experience, but are split into different plugins for the sake of modularity. Some features might also employ the help of third-party plugins, which will be listed when necessary.

## Getting Started
To start, download the latest release of the [GreenPandaCore][1] plugin, as it it required for most other plugins. Then take a look at some of the other plugins and choose which ones you'd like. For any plugins that have custom textures, such as items or mobs, you'll also need the required [resource pack][2].

## API
If you want to use the GreenPandaCore to make your own plugins, then feel free! It's licenced under the MIT license, which means you can use it in basically any way that you want. You can use most of the other plugins in your own projects too, but check the license on each one to make sure.
