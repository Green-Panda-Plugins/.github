# The Green/Panda Mega Plugin Pack Experience

This pack is a collection of plugins made by us, aimed at improving the Minecraft experience and adding lots of new features while also staying true to the game. For the sake of modularity different features might be split into separate plugins, but it is intended as a single unified experience. You can install the plugins for your own server, or request to join our server.

Every feature in this pack is intended to be run on the same server as a single experience, but may be split into different plugins for the sake of modularity. Some features might also employ the help of third-party plugins, which will be listed when necessary.
